Ozzillate is a web based application that allows you to send and receive files to and from nearby devices through the help of sound waves. You only need a speaker and a microphone, which means that the software can run on most older as well as newer hardware.

The project's website can be found at: https://www.ozzillate.com/

## Open Source?

If the project becomes open source in the future, all source code files together with build instructions will be uploaded to this repository.
